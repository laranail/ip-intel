/**
 * Pinned to the **php84** set, matching this package's `^8.4.1 || ^8.5` floor.
 *
 * Not php85, which is what `laranail/chrono` uses — chrono's floor is `^8.5` and its value objects
 * are built on `clone ($this, [...])`. Atlas supports 8.4, so the 8.5 set would rewrite code into
 * syntax that parses on the newer CI job and fails on the older one, which is the quietest possible
 * way to break a supported version.
 *
 * Generated files are skipped: `tools/build-dataset.php --check` asserts the dataset matches what
 * the generator emits byte for byte, so a Rector rewrite would put the two permanently at odds.
